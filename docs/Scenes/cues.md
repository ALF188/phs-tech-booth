# Using a Cue List

1. Open the cue list index by opening a new tab and selecting **Cue List Index**.
2. Select an existing cue list if you're looking to edit, or creating a new one by typing in `Cue` and an unused cue list number.

You can see all the current cues on a cue list in the **Cue List** tab.

### Recording Cues Live

1. Go into live by clicking the `Live` button.
2. [Manipulate your channels](./channels.md) however you would like. 
3. Make sure your cue list is selected by typing in `Cue` and the number you chose earlier. 
4. Type in `Record Cue`, the cue list number you selected, `/`, and the cue number (1 is the first cue on the list, and so forth).
> Ex: `Record Cue 3/5` <br>You can overwrite cues that are already made, so be careful! <br> Another useful command is `Record Cue Next`, which just records the next number on the list. If the last number is 4, it will record 5. If the last number is 3.4, it will record 3.5.

You can also use decimal points to place cues in between. For example, Cue 3.5 would be between 3 and 4.  

### Recording Cues Blind

1. Go into blind by clicking the `Blind` button.
2. Open your cue list in the **Cue List** tab. 
3. Make a new cue by typing in `Cue`, the cue list number, `/`, and the cue number. Confirm.
4. Open your **Blind Table**, and [manipulate your channels](./channels.md) to your liking.
5. Once you're finished, it should be automatically saved.
> Please note that the cue will not automatically update live if it is currently active. You just have to go back one cue.

### Recording Cues Blind (Alternatively)

1. Make a temporary [submaster](./index.md) and [manipulate the channels](./channels.md).
2. Copy it to a cue list by typing `Submaster # Copy To Cue #/#` and replacing the # with the proper numbers as listed above.
