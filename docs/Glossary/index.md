# Glossary

This is by no means a complete glossary, and if you have any questions, Google is your best friend. 

Also, there is a tab in the bottom left of soundboard's left monitor that is a searchable manual. It is very useful if you know what things are called, or if you're just looking for new things to learn.

The online manual can be found at this [link](https://www.etcconnect.com/uploadedFiles/Main_Site/Documents/Public/Video_Tutorial/Ion_L1_Workbook_v2.6.0_revA.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

#### Faders

<sub>Faders are the physical sliders on the board that generally control submasters. You can change what they control, but that is just the general usage. There is also virtual representations of these in the software that you can control, but I suggest using the physical ones.

#### Mode

<sub>There are two modes, blind and live. 

<sub>Blind mode overwrites the current preset and is saved, and live mode is a temporary command that will be removed.

#### Touchscreen

<sub>The touchscreen is the box sitting to the left the physical board. There is another one of these in the backstage control panel as well.
