# Using the Faders

> If you don't know what a fader is, check out our [glossary](../Glossary/index.md)

On the left side of the board, there are 20 faders, split into two rows. 
Find the fader that you're looking for and slide it up to the intensity that you desire. 

If you don't know what fader you're looking for, feel free to slide the faders up and down to see what you think looks the best.
Alternatively, check out our guide to [building a scene](index.md).
