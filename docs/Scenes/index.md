# Building a Scene

### Submasters

A submaster is a preset scene, programmed in [Blind](../Glossary/index.md), and usually mapped to a [fader](../Glossary/index.md) to control the intensity.

### Creating a Submaster

1. Open the submaster tab by clicking the already open submaster tab or opening a new tab and selecting **Submasters**.
2. Choose a number that isn't already in use by a different submaster in the left column. 
3. Press `Sub` and the number you selected. Hit `Enter`.
4. Press `Label` and use the on-screen keyboard or the physical one to name it.

#### Assigning a Fader

1. Open the fader tab by clicking the open fader tab or opening a new tab and selecting **Fader List Display**.
2. Choose which row you would like your fader on, and what position from the left. 
> You can have up to 34 different rows of faders, but we have never used more than the 2 rows that are on the default screen.
> <br> *To switch screens, press the `Fader Page` button to cycle through screens.*
3. Type [Row] / [Fader Number] and hit `Enter`.
4. Select the **Mapped To** Column that is in the the row you just created and is most likely highlighted. 
5. Click **unmapped** and select **Sub**.
6. Type in the number submaster that you selected earlier in the **ID** box. 

### Editing a Submaster

1. Clear the command line and type in `Sub` and the number submaster you would like to edit. Press `Enter`.
2. If not already in [Blind](../Glossary/index.md) mode, please click `Blind`.
3. Open the blind table by clicking the blind tab tab or opening a new tab and selecting **Blind Table**.
4. [Manipulate the channels](./channels.md) to your liking.
5. Everything saves automatically, so no need to save.
