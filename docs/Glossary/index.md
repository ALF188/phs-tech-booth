# Glossary

This is by no means a complete glossary, and if you have any questions, Google is your best friend. 

Also, there is a tab in the bottom left of soundboard's left monitor that is a searchable manual. It is very useful if you know what things are called, or if you're just looking for new things to learn. 

The online manual can be found at this [link](https://www.etcconnect.com/uploadedFiles/Main_Site/Documents/Public/Video_Tutorial/Ion_L1_Workbook_v2.6.0_revA.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
